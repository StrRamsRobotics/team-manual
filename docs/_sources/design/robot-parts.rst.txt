Components
==========

**Wheels**

Some types of wheels:
 - Standard wheels
 - Omni wheels (Standard wheels but with more wheels attached)
 - Ball wheels/ Caster wheels
 - Orientable/ Caster wheels

**Motors**

Components of a motor (`helpful video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c&t>`_):
 - Brushed (hex motors are brushed)
     - Cheaper to construct
     - Easily repairable
     - No controller required
     - Used in FTC as brushless motors require too much energy from the battery
 - Brushless:
     - Effective at high speeds
     - High efficiency and high output power to size ratio
     - Reduced size
     - Better thermal characteristics
         - Brushes cause friction as they are in direct contact with commutator 
 - Servo
     - Servos are motors with a closed feedback loop and high gear reduction commonly used for powering arms

**Sensors** 

`helpful site for sensors <https://www.javatpoint.com/types-of-robot-sensors>`_

 - Light sensor
     - Light sensors are used for detecting light
     - There are two main types of light sensor
         - Photoresistor: resistance varies with change in light intensity
         - Photovoltaic cells (Solar cell): this device is usually considered as an energy source but can be converted into a sensor if combined with capacitors and transistors 
 - Ultrasonic sensor
     - Ultrasonic sensors generates high frequency sound waves and receives thses waves in order to find out where an obect is
     - These sensors are most commonly used for distance measurements 
 - Acceleration sensor
     - This type of sensor is used for measuring acceleration and tilt. 
     - When a robot accelerates and generates vibration, it causes the mass to get compressed and produces an electrical charge which is proportional to the force
     - With acceleration sensor, the robot can measure and determine where the robot is and monitor its movement
 - Temperature sensor
     - Temperature sensor is used for measuring the change in temperature
     - In order to measure the change in temperature, the sensor measures the change in voltage difference 

**Channels**

Usually metal beams used to construct the general body of the robot

- C channels
     - Tapered flanges

- U channels:
     - Parallel flanges

**Brackets**
 - Variety of shapes depending on structure
 - Used to reinforce/support structures 
 - For example, it may reinforce the connection between two channels

**Rails**
 - Normally metal beams with a channel within which other components can slide through
 - This is helpful for components that move in one direction

- X-Rail
     - It has four channels in which components can slide through

**Mounts**

Variety of shapes depending on component

As the name suggests, the mount attaches a component to the structure

- Motor mount

**Plates**

A flat piece of metal with holes in it

Plates are useful in reinforcing the structure
