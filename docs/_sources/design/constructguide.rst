Construct: The support tool
---------------------------

-  The Construct tool is an extremely useful as it allows you to create
   imaginary objects to create components on
-  Construct is THE support tool because it is used to guide or provide
   a platform for other tools
-  However, these imaginary objects can only be created RELATIVE to
   existing real or imaginary objects

Planes: 2D
----------

-  Flat 2D planes can be made using Construct, with the default option
   being the Offset Plane which was previously covered
-  Planes are extremely versatile as they can be sketched on to create a
   variety of shapes with different tools
-  For Example, Loft:

-  A sketch can be drawn on an Offset Plane to set up the loft tool

-  As you can see, a transitional shape was created between the two
   sketches on the original plane and the Offset Plane
-  There is a variety of ways to create an imaginary plane using the
   Construct Plane tools which are self-explanatory

Axes: 1D
--------

-  A straight 1 dimensional line or axis, can be created with Construct
-  An axis can be used to rotate components around or it can act as an
   edge
-  This is useful in combination with other tools such as revolve:

-  A sketch can be Revolved around a Constructed Axis |image0|
-  Again, the different tools of the Axis Construct section are simple
   and relate to what the axis is created from

Points: 0D
----------

-  With Construct, a single point can be created to use as a vertex
-  This creates an imaginary point at a very specific location, but
   there is less versatility as it lacks dimensions
-  Points are mostly used to aid the other Construct tools with the
   options such as Plane Through Three Points or Axis Through Two Points
-  |image1|
-  As you can see here, two points are constructed on the vertices of
   this cube
-  |image2|
-  An axis can be created through these two points for further use
-  The tools of Point Construct are just as the names suggest
