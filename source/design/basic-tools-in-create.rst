Basic Tools in Create
=====================

These tools are similar to extrude in the way that objects are created from 2D sketches, or faces

Resolve
=======
- First select a sketch with Resolve
- Then select the axis you want the sketch to rotate around
- Enter the desired angle to click and drag the rotate option when revolving

Sweep
=====

.. note::
 We like to call this "the cooler extrude"

- To use Sweep, a path is needed. Make a 2D sketch on a plane that is perpendicular to the 2D object/profile that Sweep will be used on
- Select a 2D sketch/profile and path with Sweep
- Adjust the distance if necessary by entering a value with 1 being the entire path (0.5 will be half of the path)

- This is Sweep with distance of 1 or 100% of the path

- This is Sweep with distance of 0.5 or 50% of the path

Loft
====

- Begin with a 2D sketch or face
- An easy way to create a straightforward loft is by using an offset plane
- Sketch the second 2D sketch on the offset plane
- Use Loft and select the two sketches to form the finished shape

- There is also an option called "Loft"

- Notice Profile 1 and Profile 2 are both under the connection option
- Change this option to "direction"
        - Now there are more ways to play around with the slope and make it curvy

Emboss
======

- Select a 2D sketch to emboss

- Then select the face to emboss the sketch onto
- You can adjust the location of the sketch on the face using the arrows

- The embossed sketch will replicate the shape of the surface unlike an extrusion
