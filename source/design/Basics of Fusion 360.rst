====================

.. contents::


This tutorial will teach you how to install and use Fusion 360

.. note:: 
    Make sure you have a student's ID ready as you will need it to prove that you are a student.


Installation 
=========================
First download the Fusion 360: `Fusion 360 Download  <https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/student-design>`_

| Fusion360 student version may need proof that you are a student (a picture of your student card, timetable, or other paper with your name and name of St. Robert).

.. note:: 
 Note that once you have sent a document for verification, it should take about 24 hours for your account to be verified.

How to Change Perspective
=========================

| Moving around is useful to get a good look at your 3D model

| Select the sphere to orbit around, the wallet to look at a face of your shape, the hand to slide your perspective across the plane, or the magnifying glasses to zoom in and out.

| In order to reselect your cursor, press Esc, or click on the icon shown below Press down on the scroll wheel to move around (pan). Hold shift + press scroll wheel to rotate (orbit).

How To Sketch a Shape
=====================
First, you will need to sketch a shape

.. image:: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/766381595879145493/774384805688639488/unknown.png
.. image:: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/766381595879145493/774380961403895828/a-hw3wdSy_cjTZdE_tsq3X53nvdukbe7ffB0_akzf3FHikgw1bcyqQSGUBR3vSb_Cxweh4-NDEtL5P1nn4gZllH3jWoYPbQuTfuS.png

Select the icon with a green plus, then select a plane to sketch your shape. The plane could be one of the coordinate planes or the face of a solid shape. In order to make your 2D sketch into the base of a 3D prism, the shape must be a closed shape.

| Use tab to swap between dimensions when sketching, and once you are done, select finish sketch on the sketch palette panel.

| You can also make 3D sketches into “space” or on a solid(see extrusion below).

Extruding 2D Sketches
=====================
Sketching a 2D shape can act as the face of a shape that can then be extruded to form a prism.

.. image:: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/766381595879145493/774386362052116530/unknown.png

Click the highlighted icon in the solid menu and then click on the sketch of your 2D shape. From there you can give the shape depth. 

.. note::
 Extrusion is also useful when you want to remove a solid from another solid (extrude negative distance).

Moving Shapes
=============
You can use the move tool in order to move shapes.

.. image:: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/766381595879145493/774381066168696832/jPriWqYX9Ti735vci1zu_FbPmMFJjtbBDcvWF24H00Oz0427nAo1-k4RzyR7LdyXPfn_8RFPWs2FK_vucLi-HO5DPfMTKjEMCTG8.png

Within the solid menu, you can use the icon on the left to move different aspects of your design (or use shortcut m). 

.. image:: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/766381595879145493/774381227847188520/XAUf4ceNZjJbsoz6jpNZCMPbp1B7y5Pnyy1QuDsQH7zgzZIMT9wtuAcfJEEGpq-FwUF5jHACwpxYTXtd6RqfXoRfBUp84BOWJr_s.png

Once you click the arrows, a panel on the right side of your screen will appear in which you can select the aspect of the design you want to move, and how you want to move it.

Hovering your cursor over any of the icons will provide you with an explanation and a possible shortcut found in parenthesis.

Useful Tools
============
**Default shortcuts for making sketch**
 - S for shortcuts and search
 - L for line
 - C for center circle
 - R for 2 point recctangle
 - O for offset


**How to add an image**
 - Images have to be in an SVG or PNG (and many other popular images extensions)

**Solid**
 Create:
  - When not using a sketch, you can use default 3d shapes as a base: box, cylinder, sphere, torus coil pipe
  - Extrude: Allows you to change the depth of a selected 2D area
  - Revolve: Makes a selected 2D area go around a selected axis
  - Hole: Choose to form a type of hole in a 3D object

 Modify:
  - You will be able to add extra details to your model by using this feature 
  - For example: you can smooth(fillet) an edge
  - Shell: Hollow out a 3D object
  - Combine or Split Body: Combines 3D objects into one entity or divides a 3D object into multiple parts
