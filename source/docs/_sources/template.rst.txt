============

.. contents::


Tutorials should be long-ish pages.
Links to the subsections will be automatically created when you use the
``.. contents::`` directive.

You should use this template as the basis for your tutorial documentaion. 

.. note:: 
    
    Just a heads up, titles need to be underlined with ``=``.
    The length of the ``=`` needs to be the same as the title.

    Same for subsections, denoted by ``-``.


Creating and Editing ``.rst`` Files
-----------------------------------

You can create and edit ``.rst`` files directly on GitHub, but the docs won't actually build.
It is possible to add a feature to make the docs build automatically whenever you commit, but
I don't have the time right now, and it would be cool if one of the team members could figure it out.


Building the Documentation
--------------------------

This website uses ``sphinx`` in order to build the documentation (html pages).
When the documentation is committed to the GitHub repository, GitHub will automatically
make the files visible on the public `Team Manual <https://strramsrobotics.github.io/team-manual/>`_ site.

To be able to build the documentation yourself, refer to this repository's ``README.md`` file.

View Page Source
----------------

If you see something on one of these pages and you don't know the markup to accomplish it,
you can always click the "View page source" link at the top right of the page.


Cheat-sheet
-----------
I've created a `cheat-sheet <cheatsheet.html>`_ of sorts for common elements. Remember to click "View page source"
to see what the markup looks like.
